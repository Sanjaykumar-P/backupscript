Linux Backup Script

This script is a simple and effective solution to create compressed backups of a specified directory on a Linux system. It is ideal for personal or project-level backups where keeping date-wise versions is important.
---
 üìå Purpose
The script:
- Compresses the contents of a source folder
- Saves the backup in a separate destination folder
- Adds the current date and time to the backup filename for easy identification
---
‚úÖ Features
- Automatic `.tar.gz` archive creation
- Includes a timestamp in each backup file name
- Stores backups in a dedicated directory
- Simple and beginner-friendly syntax
- Requires minimal configuration

 üìÅ Default Setup
- **Source Folder:** `many`  
- **Backup Folder:** `backup`  
- **Backup Filename Format:** `file_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.tar.gz`
---
üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
1. Displays a welcome message and the current date/time.
2. Creates a compressed archive of the `many` folder.
3. Stores the backup file inside the `backup` directory with a unique timestamp.
4. Confirms that the backup has been created.
---
 How to Use
- Place all the files you want to back up inside the `many` folder.
- Make the script executable and run it.
- The backup file will be saved automatically in the `backup` folder.
